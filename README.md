# liri-node-app

LIRI is a language interpretation and recognition interface. It receives a user input to search Spotify for songs, Bands in Town for concerts, or OMDB for movies. It can also read commands from a local text file, "random.txt".

LIRI is a CLI app that uses node to determine the user input. To use LIRI, clone it to your local disk, then open a terminal window and navigate to LIRI's root directory (which will contain liri.js).
